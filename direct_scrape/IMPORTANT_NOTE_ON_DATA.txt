Due to bugs I noticed that toward the end of my scraping programs, perhaps due to my laptop, the connectivity gets lost. This causes data at the end to get lost.

Hence, as per my fix, if you have a bunch of files like

blouin_1_to_100.csv
blouin_36_to_120.csv
blouin_75_to_121.csv
...

This means that in the first file, for example, my program lost connectivity after painting 36.

Paintings 1-36 will be in the first file, 36-75 will be in the second file, and so forth. Painting 36, for instance, will be both at the end of 1_to_100 and the beginning of 36_to_120.



Also: note that the first real batch of data I have (5940000 to 6100000, which had missing data starting from 6046096 onward) does not have the IDs next to the paintings.
